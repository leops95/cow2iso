# cow2iso

This is my first repository. I made a STATA code for converting the [Correlates of War](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/) (COW) country classification into the conventional [United Nations ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/Country-Code) (ISO3) specification. Can be useful for merging trade and bilateral datasets. Some COW country codes are the same as ISO3 but not for the same country (i.e Slovenia = SLV using ISO3 but El Salvador = SLV using COW). Hence, replacement of the three-digit identifier has been correclty ordered in order to avoid conflicts.

Please refer to the COW website for eventual classification changes and updates. All remaining errors are on my own.
